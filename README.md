# Intro to Data Science using Python and Visual Studio Code

This session will guide you through using VS Code and Python with some common data science libraries to explore a basic data evaluation scenario. Specifically, using passenger data from the Titanic, you will learn how to set up a data science environment, import and clean data, create a machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic, and evaluate the accuracy of the generated model.

### Requirements:

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow.
